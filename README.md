## Why "Sazón"? 🌶️
As a Venezuelan cooking student and programmer, I wanted to:
- Pay homage to our culinary concept of "sazón" - that special touch that makes food delicious
- Create a tool that helps me organize recipes from my cooking classes

### Combine my two passions: coding and cuisine

## Future Enhancements 🚀
- User authentication
- Meal planning calendar
- Shopping list generator
- Cooking timer integration
